<H1><b>Introduction</H1></b>
</center>
<p>
<H1> The PH scale is a scientific tool, it is use to measure the strength of acids<br>
and bases in liquids. Acids often taste sour. This experiment show us how to get the PH<br> 
scale of each material it can be acid,neutral,or base.There are a series of<br> 
numbers from 0 to 14, it can be acid if it is from 0 to 6, neutral if it is 7,<br>  
and base from 8 to 14. The color of the acid ones is ligther, the neutrals doesn't<br>
and the base are darker colors.<br>

<H1><b>Hypothesis</H1></b>
<p>
<H1> If we test different products like<br>
soda,lemon juice,and other products<br>
with purple cabbagge juice we will see that their PH<br>
is lower than 7 that means that is acid. And this will<br>
happen with other products but they will have different PH.<br>
Slippery or bitter substannces like soap or baking soda will have high PH.<br>
